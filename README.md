Java Developer | Spring Web | Spring MVC | Spring JPA | MySQL | REST APIs | Gradle | JSON | Thymeleaf

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a Java developer in Texas, and I have been programming since 2018. I completed an MIS degree at the University of Texas at Austin in 2021. I am primarily a backend Java developer focused on the Spring framework. I completed a nine-month Java boot camp, and I am looking to contribute to a company that provides challenges and opportunities for growth.
